                Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Garrett, a recent high school graduate and planning to attend UCSD
                in the fall this year. I am a developer of various things, and I've worked on a wide variety of projects
                in the past, including Android development, FRC control systems, and TI calculators. Programming is something
                I'm passionate about, and I just love coding and learning whatever I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is just a personal project for me to learn web development and a place for me to nerd out and talk about my ongoing projects.
                It also serves as a hub so that anyone can look through my independent projects in one place, and possibly a
                future portfolio/resume if I want a job or something. Stuff is still under construction around here, but
                feel free to have a look around!
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, here's a picture of me at Google Headquarters.
