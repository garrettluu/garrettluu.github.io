                This website is my personal project as I attempt to learn web development. HTML was easy enough, CSS is
                awkward, and JavaScript doesn't really make sense yet. Obviously, I still have many things to learn in
                this process, and will need to break some habits I established with Java, C, and all those other OOP
                languages. I have done some JS in the past using JQueryUI, but none of that really applies to this site
                yet. Hopefully, I could keep this site simple, running only HTML and CSS as it is right now.
            </p>

                My main problem with CSS is aligning elements with each other. Android XML has a convenient solution with
                LinearLayouts and ways to adjust spacing, as well as RelativeLayout to align elements relative to each
                other. CSS doesn't seem to have an equivalent, and I don't want to resort to using tables and other junk
                instead of properly learning the conventions. Columns were the obvious solution at first, but can't have
                different lengths from each other.
