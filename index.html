                Testing out animations in JavaScript, and modified some parts of the site. You'll notice now that images
                have a click-to-zoom function, with some nice fade-in and fade-out animations to go along with it. I also
                experimented with a new way of handling navigation between pages. The site is now technically on one page,
                with fade transitions if you click on About and Blog (Projects is still not using this system). I came up
                with a clever, albeit inefficient way of handling this navigation and animations. Again, there's probably
                better ways to do this, but this is my solution for now.
            </p>

                <img src="styles/images/entry2.png" id="img2" width="372px" height="auto">
                <figcaption>Really Ugly Code I'm Sorry</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                When you click on one of the buttons, the animation for the current block of text starts, and creates a
                new blogeventlistener that waits for the end of the animation. When the animation ends, the next animation
                is started up, and an abouteventlistener is created. Now, were are on the other page, so going back to
                the original involves creating an abouteventlistener, which causes the blogeventlistener to also start up.
                I like to visualize this as a ball being thrown back and forth between the two eventlisteners (the ball
                in this case can be the nav variable, which changes depending on which option is selected).
            </p>

                This game of catch is easy to replicate for two buttons, but becomes more difficult if we try
                to involve another player in the form of a third button. Another downside is that if you click the buttons
                too fast, the page will become stuck, and you'll need to refresh the page for the animations to work again.
                I'll try to find an easier, less insane way of implementing these fade animations in the future. More
                updates and fixes are coming soon.

                First blog entry! This website is my personal project as I attempt to learn web development. HTML was easy enough, CSS is
                awkward, and JavaScript doesn't really make sense yet. Obviously, I still have many things to learn in
                this process, and will need to break some habits I established with Java, C, and all those other OOP
                languages. I have done some JS in the past using JQueryUI, but none of that really applies to this site
                yet. Hopefully, I could keep this site simple, running only HTML and CSS as it is right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main problem with CSS is aligning elements with each other. Android XML has a convenient solution with
                LinearLayouts and ways to adjust spacing, as well as RelativeLayout to align elements relative to each
                other. In the image below, the whole space is a vertical LinearLayout, and each element in the list is
                a horizontal LinearLayout with the icon and text. While this is most likely not the most efficient method,
                it is incredibly easy to visualize and design our app layout around this principle of nested LinearLayouts.
            </p>

                <img src="styles/images/entry1.png" id="img1" width="310px" height="auto">
                <figcaption>Example of Linear Layouts</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                CSS doesn't seem to have an equivalent, and I don't want to resort to using tables and other junk
                instead of properly learning the conventions. Columns were the obvious solution at first, but can't have
                different lengths from each other unless I use various third-party frameworks. I'll just have to make do
                until I find a better solution, or find some framework that has similar functionality to LinearLayouts
                from Android.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web development isn't as hard as I thought it would be, but there is still a learning curve and surprises
                along the way. Hopefully I can improve my skills and learn more things along the way, and I'm excited to
                see where this journey takes me.

            Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Garrett, just a developer of various things.
            Not much to see here yet, since I'm still building this site. Hopefully you'll return soon.
