                First blog entry! This website is my personal project as I attempt to learn web development. HTML was easy enough, CSS is
                awkward, and JavaScript doesn't really make sense yet. Obviously, I still have many things to learn in
                this process, and will need to break some habits I established with Java, C, and all those other OOP
                languages. I have done some JS in the past using JQueryUI, but none of that really applies to this site
                yet. Hopefully, I could keep this site simple, running only HTML and CSS as it is right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main problem with CSS is aligning elements with each other. Android XML has a convenient solution with
                LinearLayouts and ways to adjust spacing, as well as RelativeLayout to align elements relative to each
                other. In the image below, the whole space is a vertical LinearLayout, and each element in the list is
                a horizontal LinearLayout with the icon and text. While this is most likely not the most efficient method,
                it is incredibly easy to visualize and design our app layout around this principle of nested LinearLayouts.

            </figure>
            <p>
                CSS doesn't seem to have an equivalent, and I don't want to resort to using tables and other junk
                instead of properly learning the conventions. Columns were the obvious solution at first, but can't have
                different lengths from each other unless I use various third-party frameworks. I'll just have to make do
                until I find a better solution, or find some framework that has similar functionality to LinearLayouts
                from Android.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web development isn't as hard as I thought it would be, but there is still a learning curve and surprises
                along the way. Hopefully I can improve my skills and learn more things along the way.
